# Solidity Contracts

This directory contains the Solidity contracts for an application with [RISC Zero] on Ethereum.
The example contract included within the template is [`EvenNumber.sol`](./EvenNumber.sol).
It holds a number, guaranteed to be even.

The Solidity libraries for RISC Zero can be found at [github.com/risc0/risc0-ethereum].

Contracts are built and tested with [forge], which is part of the [Foundry] toolkit.
Tests are defined in the `tests` directory in the root of this template.

## Generated Contracts

As part of the build process, this template generates the `ImageID.sol` and `Elf.sol` contracts.
Running `cargo build` will generate these contracts with up to date references to your guest code.

- `ImageID.sol`: contains the [Image IDs][image-id] for the guests implemented in the [methods] directory.
- `Elf.sol`: contains the path of the guest binaries implemented in the [methods] directory.
  This contract is saved in the `tests` directory in the root of this template.
